Cringemoment has broken the PPB Ultra WR for 140p, becoming the first person to pass 470PPB. He does claim this wasn‚Äôt deserved, but, hey, he got it! Feesh piles on with the **first ever sub 20s 10PC Sprint!** With both world records broken, admins are fretting about how to make new color roles‚Ä¶

As of now, PC Newsletter isn‚Äôt doing that well, but we‚Äôre getting through it. Hopefully with the addition of Holifyre (and possibly Jim? I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs here to write or just to help manage) we‚Äôre actually nearly reaching the group chat limit. We‚Äôll see where this goes. With the amount of world records and personal bests this week, I think everyone should take some time out of their day to try a category you haven‚Äôt done in a while. Maybe you‚Äôll do well :oyes:

This has been algebruh, and I wish you all a great (rest of your) week!

Hey PC Gang, I‚Äôm pake, and I bring you the PC Newsletter of all time. In this week‚Äôs edition we have quite an assortment of crazy PBs ranging from Fragmented‚Äôs (NitenTeria) first ever 100+ run on Techmino, to a low 26s 10PC run by QuickandSmart (#6 on jstris 10PC), as well as Kvodeth breaking the 900k barrier on Blitz (Global #91). On the research side of things, Hsterts made great strides on 5th, generating a comprehensive see-7 minimal set of braindead setups. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that algebruh started an attempt at seeing how far a robot could consecutively PC with see-7 using all the resources we have available.

Speaking of algebruh, he joined the PC Newsletter team this week. We now consist of 4 members: Hosef, huye, 13pake, and algebruh.

If we missed anything please let us know! If you have pure PC research outside of #pc-research make sure to post your findings there so we don‚Äôt miss it. Happy PCing everyone! :pepenter:

**Postscript** :star:

Hello PC gang, I'm huye, and this is the 3rd week of PC gang newsletter :oyes:! This week, we got a pretty big compilation of pbs in the PC mode category, many of which were milestone-reaching ones. While there are less entries on the Ultra, Blitz and Sprint modes, this is well balanced by the numerous chokes by misdrops plaguing the community as usual (rip) (Lady RNG is gonna be kinder next time).
Not included, but there have also been many cute üò∫bektangleüò∫ runs this week, check them out if you're interested!

Our newsletter team is also getting bigger: starting from this week, pepperoni joined as a helper.
Therefore, we now consist of 5 members: Hosef, 13pake, huye, algebruh and pepperoni.

That's all for this week's news, thanks everyone for reading and we hope you'll have a great PC week!!!‚ú®

**PC News #4** - *12/05/2022*

Hello! This is Algebruh, here with week number four of the PC Newsletter. This will be a rather short newsletter, but we have to push out *something* that gets us read.
We saw a large decline in general runs, but a *heavy* uptick in PPB Ultra runs, so I‚Äôve decided to delete the categories with no runs and pick out some of my favorite PPB Ultra runs. ~~Don‚Äôt expect this to be recurring.~~
And, just as I was wrapping up to post this, Holifyre breaks his Invisible PC Mode PB and WR by a whole‚Ä¶ two PCs. ‚ÄúDied on 6th as always‚Äù, he notes.


**PBs** :sparkles:
__Consecutive PCs__
```
1. Holifyre       Invisible 157 PC (Jstris)
1. pensil         38 PC (Jstris)
2. mdragon6580    35 PC (Jstris)
3. Ryanisthebest  17 PC (Jstris)

1. TamTheBoss111  31.958s (Jstris)
2. Minnevich      58.133s (Tetr.io)

__PPB Ultra__
With a rather large spike in PPB Ultra runs and zero Pure PC Ultra(nor Pure PC Blitz) runs, I‚Äôve replaced Pure PC Ultra with PPB Ultra. stickmancomic got the WR just last week, and many others have PBd in this timeframe.
```
1. stickmancomic        469.09 PPB @ 140P
2. JimothyJimothy       460.09 PPB @ 140P

This was a rather slow week for research, PBs and other achievements. algebruh has furthered some research on 7th -> 8th setups, but it‚Äôs spotty. The newsletter gang has lost a member in Huye, (but they will always be ~~in our hearts~~ reading our newsletter) and gained a member in cringemoment! The member count will stay the same :widepeepohappyL:
Adding on to Huye‚Äôs **Postscript**note about the PC Bot, it is currently on 635 PCs on it‚Äôs first run.

Hi PC Gang.
This **Postscript**is brought to you late by Tam. This week there has been a decent amount of research in trying to collate 7th data into easy to read forms notably by algebruh and NitenTeria. There have also been numerous PBs in consecutive PC Mode as mentioned above. We hope you all had a great New Years and may you all reach new heights in 2023!

Happy PCing!

I‚Äôm also omitting Trivia and **Joke of the week**for lack of time. Sorry, you guys have to be sad now, I guess :(

Hi Gang.

Happy PCing!

PC News #9 - 01/18/2023
This week we have multiple WRs, including Holifyre breaking his PB  . He now owns the first and only 3 300PCs that exist. Cringemoment has broken the PPB Ultra WR for 140p, becoming the first person to pass 470PPB. He does claim this wasn‚Äôt deserved, but, hey, he got it! Feesh piles on with the first ever sub 20s 10PC Sprint! With both world records broken, admins are fretting about how to make new color roles‚Ä¶

As of now, PC Newsletter isn‚Äôt doing that well, but we‚Äôre getting through it. Hopefully with the addition of Holifyre (and possibly Jim? I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs here to write or just to help manage) we‚Äôre actually nearly reaching the group chat limit. We‚Äôll see where this goes. With the amount of world records and personal bests this week, I think everyone should take some time out of their day to try a category you haven‚Äôt done in a while. Maybe you‚Äôll do well :oyes:

**Trivia of the Week** ü§ì

4p Legs is a popular BCF setup that has a PC chance of 99.52% on 1st. Out of all the possible 5040 see-7 queues, there are only 24 "fail queues" that result in no solutions. Interestingly, all the 24 fail queues have a commonality, which is that they all contain a subset of 4 pieces from the second bag following the leftover three pieces from the first bag after setup.

Assuming that one has built the left-side 4p Legs (ILZO) on 1st, what are the 4 pieces from the second bag that may result in a fail queue on this scenario?
*Note: Not all queues having these 4 pieces as the last 4 in the queue are fail queues. Some orders do allow for solutions.

Heyo everyone! This is Holifyre with the eleventh issue of PC newsletter. This past week saw some notable PB's from users of diverse levels, and a new World Record on Jstris Invisible Skin PC Mode.

The PC newsletter team is trying to agree on a specific time and date for a regular delivery of each week's newsletter, as the last couple of them have been published a bit late due to there not being an officially established schedule. We'll announce soon about on what day of the week and at what time (in UTC) the newsletter will be posted every week.

And as always, if you have a post that seems worthy of mention in the newsletter, or if we missed any of your PBs, feel free to post it in the thread newsletter-material in the general channel. We still check individual channels for runs and records but the thread saves us a lot of time and sanity.

We also accept suggestions for what topics to add to the newsletter! You can add those in the same thread newsletter-material also. We are striving weekly to make the newsletter better and better for y'all :oyes:

Happy PC'ing, everyone!

**Trivia of the Week**ü§ì

The maximum number of perfect clears one can perform on 40L Sprint Mode is 13. This requires an insane amount of 2L luck and is hence very rare. There are several ways to do this, and below is an example 13PC 40L sequence that has 7 4Ls and 6 2Ls in an alternating fashion.
4L-2L-4L-2L-4L-2L-4L-2L-4L-2L-4L-2L-4L

On which # of PC (2nd~8th) does a 2L NOT occur in this run?

**Joke of the week**üòÜ
(Credits to @moment for the joke.)

A local church nearby a river had a fishing contest. After a few rounds, there were only 2 competitors remaining. Now, one guy was huge, standing at a respectable 6‚Äô6. The other guy was only 5‚Äô2 at best.

After a couple of tense hours, the competitors returned with their fish. The tall guy had a pretty respectable fish, but the other guy‚Äôs was massive. It had to be at least two hundred kilograms. The people inside the church were losing their mind! This was the biggest fish anyone had ever seen. It had to be the biggest fish in the world.

One of the altar boys, in his excitement, accidentally dropped a candle he was holding, and the church caught on fire. Everyone ran out, and the smaller guy dropped his prize fish on the ground, leading to the fish being hopelessly trampled by the panicking crowd. Since the fire happened before measuring of the fish, he could not prove that he had the superior fish.

So, small‚Äôs fish had the world record, but then the holy fire took it away.

Hey everyone! Holifyre here again with the 13th issue of the PC Gang Newsletter. This week was quite an eventful fiasco, with Smolfeesh's monumental collection of ALL achievement-related roles in the server (the last ones being Sub20 10PC sprint and 150K Pure PC Ultra), the first ever 100 100+ PC runs on Jstris by a single user (Holifyre), NitenTeria's student mww covering a lot of ground with a PB of 56PC, and other players getting respectable PBs on Jstris PC mode.

From next week and on, the newsletter will be released at or before 23:59 UTC every Monday. And we're planning to add a new segment to the next newsletter; stay tuned!

And as always, please post any noteworthy replays or posts of yours on newsletter-material if you want them to be featured here. It makes us writers' job a whole lot easier!

Happy PC'ing! :oyes:
